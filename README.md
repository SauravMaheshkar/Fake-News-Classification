# Fake News Classification

We have all seen fake news forwards on our WhatsApp messages. Generally, these articles are generated by bots and internet trollers and are used with an intent to intrigue the audience and mislead them. Fake news can be very dangerous as it can spread misinformation and inflict rage in public. It is now becoming a serious problem in India due to more and more people using social media and lower levels of digital awareness.
